<h2>Devuan install guide</h2>

<p>
This is an easy to follow guide to installing Devuan from the CD/DVD 
images for supported hardware. The general advice accompanying this 
guide is that you should always backup your data before you begin.
</p>

<h2 id="installing">Live install</h2>

<p>
This installation procedure uses the graphical desktop-live installer 
from the running live image. It may be launched from the desktop icon or
 the system menu.
</p>

<p><strong><i>0) Before you start</i>:</strong> Please read the RELEASE NOTES provided on the desktop.</p>

<p><strong><i>1) Security warning</i>:</strong> The root password of 
this live installer is publicly known, which is a security risk when 
connecting to the internet. It is recommended to change the root 
password before continuing:
</p>
<p>
<code>~$ sudo passwd</code></p>

<p>Begin the install by double-clicking the <em>Install Devuan</em> icon on the desktop.
</p>

<p><strong><i>2.1) BIOS MBR mode</i>:</strong>  This window comes up in the amd64 desktop-live install if you're installing on a BIOS system. Choose 'Continue'.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl02.png" alt="bios-notice">
</p>

<p><strong><i>2.2) UEFI mode</i>:</strong> In a UEFI install, this informs 
you whether you have a proper EFI partition or not. If an EFI partition 
is detected, make sure that it resides on the first disk before 
continuing.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl02_002.png" alt="efi-notice">
</p>

<p><strong><i>2.3) Help</i>:</strong> Additional options and information.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl02_003.png" alt="help">
</p>

<p><strong><i>3.1) Installation options</i>:</strong> Choose your installation 
options here. For example, you can choose to have certain directories 
mounted as a partition instead of installing to a single root partition.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl03.png" alt="options">
</p>

<p><strong><i>3.2) Encryption</i>:</strong> The installer can only encrypt root and home
filesystems.  A separate boot partition is optional and will be unencrypted if present. 
For full protection of your data you should not use a separate swap partition. If 
there is no swap partition, a swap file will be created on the root filesystem 
and that will be encrypted.</p> 

<p>For traditional hard disks you can choose to write random data to encrypted 
partitions for additional security. This can take a long time depending 
on the size of partitions.  You might not want to do this for Solid State Drives 
due to their write limits.
</p>

<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl03_003.png" alt="options-encrypt">
</p>

<p><strong><i>3.3) Boot directory encryption</i>:</strong> By default the boot 
directory will be encrypted. This is generally a good idea for full disk 
encryption setups.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl03_002.png" alt="full-disk-notice">
</p>

<p><strong><i>4.1) Summary</i>:</strong> This screen reminds you of the partitions 
currently on your system before you prepare a location to install Devuan.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl04_003.png" alt="choose-partitioner">
</p>

<p><strong><i>4.2) Choose a partitioning method</i>:</strong> If the drive is 
already partitioned you can skip this step.  You will now be 
presented choices for how you'd like to partition your installation 
drive. The easiest of these options is to use GParted. Choose GParted 
to continue with this walkthrough, as the other options are 
beyond the scope of this discussion.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl04_002.png" alt="choose-partitioner">
</p>

<p><strong><i>4.3) Using GParted</i>:</strong> You should now create your 
partitions with GParted. You will need to create at least a root 
filesystem and any partitions you previously told the installer about. 
If warned by GParted to do so, create a partition table according to 
your boot mode which was discussed earlier - use an <code>msdos</code> 
partition table for MBR boot mode or a <code>gpt</code> partiton 
table for UEFI boot mode. This window shows a valid partition scheme for a UEFI install
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl04.png" alt="gparted">
</p>

<p><strong><i>5.1) Bootloader location</i>:</strong> Now, on an i386 machine you will be asked where the 
bootloader should be installed. In most cases you should choose to 
install the GRUB bootloader to the MBR.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl05.png" alt="grub-location">
</p>

<p><strong><i>5.2) Choose bootloader location</i>:</strong> To continue, now specify 
the device for installation of the bootloader.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl05_002.png" alt="grub-location">
</p>

<p><strong><i>6) Choose the installation partition</i>:</strong> You should now 
choose the partition to which Devuan will be installed. This should be one of 
the partitions you formatted earlier. To use other filesystems, pre-format 
them and choose 'Do not format' in the options window.  If you chose a separate 
/home or /boot, you'll get similar windows for each.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl06.png" alt="choose-root">
</p>

<p><strong><i>7) Choose a filesystem</i>:</strong> Now choose which ext 
filesystem to use. There are three choices available for filesystems. The 
most recent iteration is the ext4 filesystem and this is what you should 
go with here.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl07.png" alt="choose-root-fs">
</p>

<p><strong><i>8.0) Summary</i>:</strong> The following 4 summaries illustrate how 
the installation might be done based on your previous choices. Only one 
of these typical options will appear during the installation process. Make 
sure these options are acceptable before proceeding with the installation, 
otherwise you should exit and start over.
</p>

<p><strong><i>8.1) Typical summary for an amd64 BIOS install</i>:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl08_002.png" alt="amd64-bios-summary">
</p>

<p><strong><i>8.2) Typical summary for an amd64 UEFI install</i>:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl08_003.png" alt="amd64-uefi-summary">
</p>

<p><strong><i>8.3) Typical summary for an i386 install</i>:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl08_004.png" alt="i386-summary">
</p>

<p><strong><i>8.4) Typical summary for an encrypted install</i>:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl08.png" alt="encrypted-summary">
</p>

<p><strong><i>9) Select your geographic area</i>:</strong> You should now choose your geographic area from the list. This will allow you to accurately set your time zone.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl09.png" alt="tzdata">
</p>

<p><strong><i>10) Choose your time zone</i>:</strong> You can now choose your time zone based on your geographic area. This will be used to configure the system clock.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl10.png" alt="tzdata2">
</p>

<p><strong><i>11) Generate additional locales</i>:</strong> The UTF-8 locale will 
be selected automatically, but you can choose to generate more according 
to your preferences. A common choice would be ISO-8859-1 or 
ISO-8859-15. If you're unsure, the defaults are safe and you can just 
continue to the next step.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl11.png" alt="locales">
</p>

<p><strong><i>12) Set the default locale</i>:</strong> Now select which locale 
that will be used. If you generated your own locales you probably want 
to select one of them here, otherwise choose UTF-8.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl12.png" alt="locales2">
</p>

<p><strong><i>13) Set the keyboard type</i>:</strong> You should now let the 
installer know how many keys your keyboard has. If you're not sure, 
choose the default as this can always be changed from
your desktop after installation in complete.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl13.png" alt="keyboard">
</p>

<p><strong><i>14) Choose a keyboard layout</i>:</strong> Choose the keyboard 
layout you want to use. This should usually be matched to your country 
unless the layout is different for some reason.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl14.png" alt="keyboard2">
</p>

<p><strong><i>15) Set special keys</i>:</strong> Here you can set whether or 
not the X server can be killed using a special key combination. If 
Control, Alt and Backspace are pressed together from your desktop the X 
server will be instantly killed.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl15.png" alt="keyboard3">
</p>

<p><strong><i>16.1) Set an encryption passphrase</i>:</strong> You should now 
choose a passphrase for any encrypted partitions. You will be required to enter the same 
password twice to confirm it. It is recommended to use a passphrase that 
is at least 20 characters long, uses upper and lower case letters, 
numbers and special characters.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl16.png" alt="confirm-partition">
</p>

<p><strong><i>16.2) Confirm the installation partition</i>:</strong> Here you will 
be asked to confirm installation to the partition chosen earlier. If the 
information matches your choices from earlier, enter Y and press return 
to continue.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl16_002.png" alt="mke2fs">
</p>

<p><strong><i>17) Installing the system</i>:</strong> The installation has started on the partition you selected. This will take some time.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl17.png" alt="install-system">
</p>

<p><strong><i>18) Install bootloader</i>:</strong> The system has 
been installed but before it can be booted you should choose to install a 
bootloader. There is also the option to chroot the install for 
<em>advanced</em> users.
</p>

<p><strong><i>18.1) BIOS install</i>:</strong> In amd64 install on BIOS, the first 
button says 'Copy files'. That will install the <code>grub-pc</code> package and install the
bootloader. If you choose 'Chroot' you'll get a new terminal chrooted into the 
installed system where you can make manual changes. This will bypass the
installation of the <code>grub-pc</code> package and the bootloader. If you want to mess around 
in chroot and still let the installer add the bootloader, don't press this button. 
Open another terminal and run <code>sudo chroot /target</code>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl18.png" alt="install-bootloader-uefi">
</p>

<p><strong><i>18.2) UEFI install</i>:</strong> In an amd64 install on 
UEFI, the first button says 'Install bootloader'. the correct grub 
package is already installed and you don't need to choose a location for
 the bootloader. It will go into the EFI partition.  Check section 2.3 
'Help' above to learn how to make a proper EFI partition.  The installer
 will complain if you don't have one.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl18_002.png" alt="install-bootloader-bios">
</p>

<p><strong><i>19) The GRUB bootloader</i>:</strong> On an amd64/BIOS install the 
<code>grub-pc</code> package will now be installed  This ensures that your system can 
boot to the newly installed operating system. GRUB is the name of the 
bootloader used here.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl19.png" alt="grub-pc">
</p>

<p><strong><i>20) Bootloader location</i>:</strong> In most cases GRUB should 
be installed to the first disk from which the system will boot. In this case there is only one disk, indicated by <code>/dev/sda</code> so GRUB should be installed there.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl20.png" alt="grub-pc2">
</p>

<p><strong><i>21) Hostname and username</i>:</strong> Enter a unique hostname to 
make it easier to identify this computer on a network without using 
spaces. Choose any username that takes your fancy but spaces and 
uppercase letters will not be accepted. In most cases there is no need 
to enter your real name, so this can be omitted.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl21.png" alt="hostname-username">
</p>

<p><strong><i>22) Root password</i>:</strong> Now set a root password if
 you haven't earlier in this installation. It's good security practise 
to set a strong password here to protect the root account.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl22.png" alt="root-password">
</p>

<p><strong><i>23) User password</i>:</strong> Now create a user account password. You should create a password that isn't easy to guess.
</p>
<p>
<img src="desktop-live-install-guide_files/dl23.png" alt="user-password">
</p>

<p><strong><i>24) Finish</i>:</strong> If you see this, you must have done it right.
</p>
