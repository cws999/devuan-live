### What's new in this release

Changes in su
 - The behavior of su has changed. Use 'su -' to get root's path or use
   the full path to commands if you use only 'su'. 
   
 - There are several ways to get the old behavior. The easiest is to 
   edit /etc/default/su to add the line:

    ALWAYS_SET_PATH yes

   See the following for more information:
   https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#su-environment-variables
   https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster
   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=905564

Pulseaudio
 - If you have no sound, make sure the following line in
   /etc/pulse/client.conf.d/00-disable-autospawn.conf is commented as
   shown here:

   #autospawn=no

Boot menu says "Debian" instead of "Devuan"

 - The default setup results in the grub menu showing 'Debian' instead
   of 'Devuan'. On UEFI hardware, this will work with secure boot.

   To change it, you can edit /etc/os-release to show ID=devuan or edit
   /etc/default/grub to GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Devuan". Then run update-grub
   to generate a new boot menu.

 - Note: If you're booting UEFI mode, you will also need to remove
   grub-efi-amd64-signed and just use grub-efi-amd64. You will not be
   able to use secure boot this way.


### Getting Devuan 3 Beowulf

Devuan 3 Beowulf is available for i386, amd64, armel, armhf, arm64 and
ppc64el platforms. Installer isos and live CDs can be downloaded at:

  http://files.devuan.org/devuan_beowulf/

Please consider using one of the many mirrors, listed at:

  https://devuan.org/get-devuan

Detailed instructions on how to use each image are available in the
corresponding 'README.txt' file. The SHA256SUMS of each set of images
is signed by the developer in charge of the build. The fingerprints of
GPG keys of all Devuan developers are listed at:

  https://devuan.org/os/team

In order to check that the images you downloaded are genuine and not
corrupted, you should:

 - download the image(s)
 - download the corresponding SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.asc files
   in the same folder
 - verify the checksums running:
   $ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
   (it could complain about missing files, but should show an "OK"
   close to the images you have actually downloaded)
 - verify the signature running:
   $ gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./devuan-devs.gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc

   (we assume that you have put the GPG keys in the keyring named
   "devuan-devs.gpg". YMMV)

The 'devuan-devs.gpg' keyring is provided only for convenience. The
most correct procedure to verify that the signatures are authentic is
by downloading the relevant public keys from a trusted keyserver,
double-check that the fingerprint of the key matches that of the
developer reported on https://devuan.org/os/team and then use that key
for verification.


### Upgrading to Devuan 3 Beowulf

Direct and easy upgrade path from Devuan ASCII and migration path
from Debian Buster to Devuan 3 Beowulf are available here: 

  https://devuan.org/os/install

If you are already on Beowulf, just run this command to get to the
current release version:

  apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade


### Devuan Package Repositories

Thanks to the support of many volunteers and donors, Devuan has
a network of package repository mirrors.  The mirror network is
accessible using the FQDN "deb.devuan.org". 

Starting from Devuan 2.0 ASCII, users should use exclusively
"deb.devuan.org" in their 'sources.list' file, e.g.:

	deb http://deb.devuan.org/merged beowulf main
	deb http://deb.devuan.org/merged beowulf-security main
	deb http://deb.devuan.org/merged beowulf-updates main
	deb http://deb.devuan.org/devuan beowulf-proposed main

Along with the above addresses, the repositories are also accessible
using the Tor network, by using our hidden service address:

	deb tor+http://devuanfwojg73k6r.onion/merged beowulf main
	deb tor+http://devuanfwojg73k6r.onion/merged beowulf-security main
	deb tor+http://devuanfwojg73k6r.onion/merged beowulf-updates main
	deb tor+http://devuanfwojg73k6r.onion/devuan beowulf-proposed main

More information is available at:

  https://devuan.org/os/packages

All the mirrors contain the full Devuan package repository (all the
Devuan releases and all the suites). They are synced every 30 minutes
from the main Devuan package repository ("pkgmaster.devuan.org") and
are continuously checked for sanity, integrity, and consistency. The
package repository network is accessed through a DNS Round-Robin.

An up-to-date list of mirrors in the network is available at:

  http://pkgmaster.devuan.org/mirror_list.txt

Users can directly access a mirror using the corresponding BaseURL.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The package mirrors at "deb.devuan.org" are signed
with the following GPG key:

	pub   rsa4096 2017-09-04 [SC] [expires: 2022-09-03]
	      E032601B7CA10BC3EA53FA81BB23C00C61FC752C
	uid  [ unknown] Devuan Repository (Amprolla3 on Nemesis
	              <repository@devuan.org>)
	sub   rsa4096 2017-09-04 [E] [expires: 2022-09-03]

The key is included in the package "devuan-keyring". In order to use
deb.devuan.org, you must have `devuan-keyring_2017.10.03` or later.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Devuan plans to eventually discontinue the original set
of Devuan mirrors available at auto.mirror.devuan.org and
{CC}.mirror.devuan.org. As a consequence, users are strongly
encouraged to use the new set of mirrors at "deb.devuan.org".


### Non-free firmware

All Devuan 3 Beowulf install media make non-free firmware packages
available at install time. These are only installed if your networking
hardware requires them in order to function. You can avoid the
automatic installation of non-free firmware by selecting the
"Expert install" option in the installation menu.

Devuan 3 Beowulf desktop-live and minimal-live images come with
non-free firmware packages pre-installed. You can remove these packages
after boot using the "remove_firmware.sh" script available under /root.


### About eudev

Following the inclusion of udev (a daemon in charge of device
management) in the systemd code tree, Devuan 3 Beowulf provides the
alternative "eudev" package. The transition from udev to eudev is
managed through transitional packages and should be automatic and
seamless.


### Session management and policykit backends

Devuan 3 Beowulf provides a choice of 5 Desktop Environments at
install time: Xfce, Cinnamon, KDE, LXQt, and MATE. Other desktop
environments and window managers are available from the repositories
post-install.

Desktop Environments rely on a session management system to allow the
user to perform certain tasks without requiring administrator
privileges such as suspending/rebooting/shutting down the system,
mounting external devices, configuring networking, and so on.

Two session management systems are available in Devuan Beowulf:

 - consolekit
 - logind (elogind and libpam-elogind)

These session managers are mutually exclusive; only one of them can be
installed and active at a time to avoid unwanted interference. In order
to grant processes in the unprivileged user session access to select
privileged operations the installed session manager is connected to the
policykit-1 framework by a set of matching back-end libraries.

The default session manager for all desktops is logind (libpam-elogind).
Xfce and Cinnamon will work with either logind or consolekit. The other
desktop environments will only work with logind.

In order for session management to work correctly the login manager
(aka display manager, DM) needs to register the user session with the
installed session manager (either consolekit or logind) which in turn
must coordinate with the relevant components of the desktop environment.

Both slim and lightdm will work with either libpam-elogind or consolekit.
Slim is the default login manager for Xfce. Lightdm is the default for
the other desktops.


### Workarounds for known lightdm issues/bugs

lightdm prevents some accessibility features from working and gives the
error, "Couldn't register with accessiblity bus" in ~/.xsession-errors.
(See Debian bug [#760740](https://bugs.debian.org/760740))

This can be mitigated in the current X session by running:

  xprop --root --remove AT_SPI_BUS

For a persistent solution edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf to add:

	xserver-share=false


Power buttons are disabled on the lightdm login screen with elogind.
(See Debian bug [#932047](https://bugs.debian.org/932047))

Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/lightdm-greeter

	session   optional pam_elogind.so


### About LXDE

LXDE is not presented as a choice during installation but can be added
after booting into the new system. Note that there is a bug in lxsession
that requires LXDE be installed without Recommends. (Debian bug #952679)

  apt --no-install-recommends install lxde


### Starting X from a terminal

In Devuan 3 Beowulf, the X server can now be run without root
privileges. As a result, some additional requirements must be met when
launching X directly from a TTY (e.g., with 'xinit' or 'startx')
especially on systems upgraded from Devuan Jessie.

In Devuan 3 Beowulf it is sufficient to install 'elogind' and
'libpam-elogind', and then use either 'startx' or 'xinit' as usual
from a regular user account. In this case, the Xorg log file will be
available under '~/.local/share/xorg/'.

The system still needs to support Kernel Mode Setting (KMS).
Therefore, this solution may not work in some virtualization
environments (e.g., virtualbox) or if the kernel has no driver that
supports your GPU.

Alternatively, it is still possible to run X with setuid root. In this
case, you need to install `xserver-xorg-legacy` and ensure that the
file '/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config' contains the (uncommented) line:

	needs_root_rights=yes


### Devuan package information pages

Devuan has a simple service to display information about all the
packages available in Devuan. It can be accessed at:

  https://pkginfo.devuan.org

It is possible to search for package names matching a set of keywords
and to see the description, dependencies, suggestions and
recommendations of each package. Please report any issues with this
service and/or get in touch if you have suggestions for how to
improve it.


### Reporting bugs

No piece of software is perfect. And acknowledging this fact is the
first step towards improving our software base.

Devuan strongly believes in the cooperation of the community to find,
report and solve issues. If you think you have found a bug in a
Devuan package, please report it to:

  https://bugs.devuan.org

The procedure to report bugs is quite simple: just install and run
`reportbug`, a tool that will help you to compile the bug report and to
include any relevant information for the maintainers.

`reportbug` assumes than you have a properly configured Mail User
Agent that can send emails. If this is not the case, you can still
prepare your bug report with `reportbug`, save it (by default reportbug
will save the report under /tmp) and then use it as a template for an
email to submit@bugs.devuan.org.

(NOTE: Devuan does not provide an open SMTP relay for `reportbug`
yet. If you don't know what this is about, you can safely ignore this
information.)

When the bug report is processed, you will receive a confirmation email
containing the number assigned to the report.

Before reporting a bug, please check whether the very same problem has
already been reported by other users.

`reportbug` is a tool made by Debian for Debian, over a timespan of
about 25 years. As a result it is sometimes difficult to adapt it
to a new setup. We are currently working to improve the integration of
reportbug with Devuan's infrastructure and to improve the management,
triaging and reporting of bugs. Please bear with us ;^)
